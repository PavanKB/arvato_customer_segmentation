# Arvato Customer Segmentation

# Introduction
Explain the business case and questions we are trying to answer

# Files
The project is organised as follows:
* `Udacity_AZDIAS_052018.csv`: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891 211 persons (rows) x 366 features (columns).
* `Udacity_CUSTOMERS_052018.csv`: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191 652 persons (rows) x 369 features (columns).
* `Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TRAIN.csv`: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42 982 persons (rows) x 367 (columns).
* `Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TEST.csv`: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42 833 persons (rows) x 366 (columns).

**TODO** Add the codes as well.

# Packages 
What are the packages needed?
`pandas`

How do we run the code?

# EDA
Explore the data 

The challenge is that we need to identify the factors which differentiate the
customers from the population.
How to do this?


Plots etc
NA analysis
Correlation?
Uniqueness of the data

# CleanUP

# Dimensionality Reduction

# Decide on the ML algo for customer segmentation
1. K-means clustering
1. Hierarchical clustering
1. SVD
1. PCA

Combined?


# Testing
Test and Train data split
Grid search for the best  - K-Fold

Give the metrics
Give the ROC

# Applications
Must be able to run from command prompt.
